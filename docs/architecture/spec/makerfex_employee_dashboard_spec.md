# Employee Dashboard Specification
## Makerfex – Employee / My Work Overview

---

## 1. Purpose

The Employee Dashboard exists to answer one question clearly and repeatedly:

**“What should I be working on right now?”**

It is designed for execution, not analysis.
For momentum, not forecasting.
For clarity, not interpretation.

The employee dashboard helps work move forward smoothly without requiring employees to understand shop-wide strategy, revenue, or risk modeling.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Execution Over Insight

Employee views prioritize:
- action
- sequencing
- blockers
- near-term deadlines

They do **not** attempt to explain why work exists — only what needs to be done next.

---

### 2.2 Tasks Are First-Class

Unlike the Owner Dashboard, tasks are the **primary unit of work** here.

Employees need to see:
- what is assigned to them,
- what is due soon,
- what is currently in progress,
- and what is blocking progress.

Tasks are not noise at this level — they are the job.

---

### 2.3 Calm, Focused Information

The Employee Dashboard must:
- avoid overload,
- minimize competing signals,
- keep attention grounded in today and this week.

Long-term forecasting and strategic metrics belong elsewhere.

---

## 3. Explicit Exclusions (Hard Rules)

The following must **not** appear on the Employee Dashboard:

- Revenue metrics
- Sales performance charts
- Marketing analytics
- Shop-wide capacity modeling
- Financial projections

Employees should never be asked to interpret business risk as part of daily execution.

---

## 4. Layout Contract (My Work Overview)

The Employee Dashboard uses a consistent layout optimized for daily use.

### 4.1 Primary Column — My Work

This area establishes:
- tasks assigned to the employee,
- current stage or workflow context,
- due dates and urgency.

This is the dominant visual region.

---

### 4.2 Secondary Column — Today & This Week

This region highlights:
- tasks due today,
- tasks due soon,
- upcoming commitments.

It reinforces pacing without overwhelming.

---

### 4.3 Optional Sidebar — Context & Activity

An optional sidebar may surface:
- recent activity,
- handoffs,
- mentions or updates,
- lightweight alerts.

This area is secondary and collapsible.

---

## 5. Task Presentation Rules

### 5.1 Required Task Attributes

Tasks shown on the Employee Dashboard must include:
- clear title
- associated project
- workflow stage
- due date (or explicit absence)
- assignment clarity

---

### 5.2 Task Ordering

Tasks should be ordered primarily by:
1. urgency
2. due date
3. workflow relevance

Manual reordering may be allowed but should not obscure urgency.

---

### 5.3 Status Indicators

Status indicators may include:
- in progress
- blocked
- waiting
- overdue

Status must be obvious at a glance.

---

## 6. Workflow & Stage Awareness

Employees should always understand:
- where their task fits in the workflow,
- what comes before,
- what comes after.

Workflow context helps employees:
- anticipate handoffs,
- understand dependencies,
- avoid local optimization that hurts flow.

Workflow visibility should be present without requiring navigation away from the dashboard.

---

## 7. Calendar & Scheduling Signals

Calendar views or scheduling indicators may be included if they:

- reinforce deadlines,
- clarify sequencing,
- support daily planning.

They must not:
- replace task lists,
- overwhelm the main execution view.

---

## 8. Interaction & Navigation Rules

From the Employee Dashboard, employees should be able to:
- open task details,
- navigate to project context,
- mark progress or completion,
- acknowledge blockers.

They should **not** be required to:
- interpret charts,
- compare metrics,
- make strategic decisions.

---

## 9. Relationship to Machine Learning

Machine learning may support employees by:
- highlighting tasks at risk of delay,
- surfacing likely blockers,
- suggesting sequencing improvements.

ML must never:
- override task priority silently,
- assign blame,
- pressure employees with predictions.

Signals must remain supportive and optional.

---

## 10. Summary Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**The Employee Dashboard exists to help people do good work today.**

It should feel:
- calm,
- obvious,
- actionable.

If an employee can open the dashboard and know what to do next without thinking — the design has succeeded.

Everything else belongs somewhere else.
