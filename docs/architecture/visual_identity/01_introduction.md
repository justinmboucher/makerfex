# Makerfex Visual Identity — Introduction

Makerfex dashboards are narrative-driven, vibrant, and insight-first. 
The purpose of this visual identity is to ensure that every dashboard 
tells a clear story with semantic color, deliberate spacing, and a 
warm, human design language tailored to makers and shop owners.
