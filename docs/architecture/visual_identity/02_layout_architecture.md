# Layout Architecture

Makerfex dashboards follow a consistent narrative flow:

- **Top:** KPI tiles, date selector, export actions.
- **Middle:** The hero chart and contextual panels that explain trends.
- **Right Insight Rail:** Recent activity, micro-insights, notifications.
- **Bottom:** Tables and detailed lists that deepen understanding.

Above-the-fold content should communicate the majority of insight.
Scrolling is reserved for depth, not filler.
