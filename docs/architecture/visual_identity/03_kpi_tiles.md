# KPI Tiles

KPI tiles form the heartbeat of every Makerfex dashboard.

Each tile contains:
1. A friendly, instantly recognizable icon.
2. A clear label paired with a bold primary value.
3. A sparkline that delivers trend context at a glance.
4. A delta footer showing directional change and timeframe.

Colors are always semantic. Minimal card chrome and subtle left-border accents give 
each tile personality without clutter.
