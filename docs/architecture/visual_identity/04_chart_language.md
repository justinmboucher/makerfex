# Chart Language

Makerfex charts persuade — they don't decorate.

## Time-Series (Hero Charts)
Used to anchor the narrative. Clear axes, readable colors, and meaningful overlays.

## Category Charts
Ideal for WIP by stage, sales by category, or inventory segmentation.

## Donut Charts
Used sparingly when a single number or status is the hero.

## Sparklines
Microvisuals used only inside KPI tiles or insight rail components.

## Gantt Charts
Allowed exclusively in project details or workload contexts — never on the main dashboards.
