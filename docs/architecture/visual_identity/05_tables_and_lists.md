# Tables and Lists

Tables must be crisp, scannable, and insight-ready.

- Square avatars with colorful backgrounds help identify roles quickly.
- Status pills use semantic colors: green (good), amber (warning), red (risk).
- Light zebra striping improves legibility.
- Utility buttons stay quiet on the far right.

Tables carry a large part of the Makerfex storytelling weight.
