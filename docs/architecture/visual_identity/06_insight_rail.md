# Insight Rail

The right-hand insight rail prevents dashboard clutter while providing helpful context.

Examples of insight rail content:
- Recent project activity
- Category performance summaries
- Quick diagnostics
- AI-powered recommendations
- Micro-trend visualizations

This space acts like a friendly assistant tapping your shoulder, not shouting in your ear.
