# Spacing, Density & Rhythm

Makerfex uses a “Goldilocks density” approach:
- Not minimalist to a fault.
- Not overcrowded.
- Just dense enough to feel productive, but airy enough to breathe.

Vertical rhythm:  
- Insight-rich components at the top.  
- Detail and data-dense components near the bottom.

Horizontal rhythm:
- KPIs → Hero chart → Insight rail.  
This creates a predictable, comfortable reading pattern.
