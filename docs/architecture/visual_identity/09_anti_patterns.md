# Anti‑Patterns

The following violate the Makerfex design DNA:

- Template dashboard syndrome
- Massive chart bloat with no insight
- Decorative visuals with no semantic meaning
- Weak color contrast or pastel-only palettes
- Rows of widgets stacked for no reason
- Charts that require guesswork
- Full-page vertical sprawl

Makerfex is crafted, not assembled.
