# How to Read an Employee Dashboard

The Employee Dashboard is your daily workbench. It uses the **Makerfex Flow** to help you stay organized, prepared, and ahead of your tasks.

## Flow Step 1 — Check the Pulse

This is your snapshot of the day:

- Tasks due today  
- What's completed  
- What's at risk or overdue  
- Quick visual badges showing priority  

If something is red, it deserves your attention now.

## Flow Step 2 — Read the Momentum

See how your workload is moving:

- Upcoming deadlines  
- Task trends  
- Progress velocity  

This step helps you pace your work and anticipate crunch moments.

---

## Flow Step 3 — Follow the Workflow

You work inside a bigger machine. This section shows:

- Where your tasks sit in the workflow  
- Who’s waiting on you  
- Who you’re waiting for  
- Bottlenecks forming ahead  

This helps you understand the *why* behind your workload.

## Flow Step 4 — Spot the Signals

Materials low?  
Dependencies unblocked?  
Team members completing upstream tasks?

Here’s where you catch:

- Inventory alerts  
- Recent activity  
- Important notes  
- Machine-learning hints  

!!! tip "ML Helps—It Doesn’t Boss You Around"
    Makerfex reveals patterns, not orders.  
    It’s here to help you stay ahead, not tell you what to do.

## Flow Step 5 — Dig Into the Details

At the bottom you’ll find:

- Task logs  
- Comments  
- Attachments  
- Time tracking  
- Project associations  

Use this section when you want the full picture behind your work.

## A Quick Example

- **Check the Pulse:** Two tasks due today—one amber, one green.  
- **Read the Momentum:** Tomorrow looks heavy.  
- **Follow the Workflow:** A bottleneck in your next stage.  
- **Spot the Signals:** Walnut boards running low for upcoming cuts.  
- **Dig Into the Details:** Logs confirm timing risks.

Your day now has clarity and direction—and you didn’t even scroll twice.

That’s the Makerfex Flow.
