# How to Read an Owner Dashboard

The Owner Dashboard gives you the balcony view of your entire shop. It uses the **Makerfex Flow** to present the story of your operation—clearly, visually, and efficiently.

---

## Flow Step 1 — Check the Pulse

Start with your KPIs. These metrics summarize the health of your shop in seconds:

- Revenue or throughput
- Active projects
- Overdue items
- Task load
- Cycle time

Sparklines and deltas help you see direction immediately—green trending up is usually great; red trending up means dig deeper.

---

## Flow Step 2 — Read the Momentum

The hero chart and trend panels show *why* the KPIs look the way they do:

- Throughput rising or falling  
- Sales fluctuations  
- Workflow speed  
- Stage-level patterns  

This is the heartbeat of your shop’s movement.

---

## Flow Step 3 — Follow the Workflow

Here you’ll see how work is flowing across your operation:

- Stage breakdowns  
- Bottlenecks  
- At-risk projects  
- High-performing areas  

This section connects metrics to people, projects, and processes.

---

## Flow Step 4 — Spot the Signals

The insight rail highlights the subtle but important things:

- Recent activity  
- Category summaries  
- Micro-trends  
- ML-driven alerts  

These signals add context without cluttering your main narrative.

---

## Flow Step 5 — Dig Into the Details

Finally, the tables and logs provide the supporting evidence:

- Activity logs  
- Detailed tasks  
- Financial records  
- Project histories  

The dashboard’s top tells the story.  
The bottom shows the receipts.

## A Quick Example

- **Check the Pulse:** Overdue projects ↑ 12%.  
- **Read the Momentum:** Throughput dipped.  
- **Follow the Workflow:** Sanding is backed up.  
- **Spot the Signals:** Several delays tied to staffing gaps.  
- **Dig Into the Details:** Three projects stalled at the same stage.

Insight achieved in under 20 seconds—that’s the Makerfex Flow.
