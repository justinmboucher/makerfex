# Dashboards in Makerfex

Dashboards in Makerfex aren’t data wallpaper — they’re story engines. They show you what’s happening, what’s changing, and where your attention belongs, all without forcing you to dig through endless tables or guess what matters.

A Makerfex dashboard follows a simple promise:

**“Tell me the story of my shop faster than my coffee wakes me up.”**

To do that, every dashboard is built on the **Makerfex Flow** — a clear, intuitive way to read the screen from top to bottom, turning complex data into a simple narrative.

## The Makerfex Flow (The Backbone of Every Dashboard)

Although each dashboard looks different depending on your role, they all follow the same reading pattern — the same flow:

1. **Check the Pulse**  
   Start with the key metrics that instantly set the scene.

2. **Read the Momentum**  
   Understand how things are moving through trends and hero visuals.

3. **Follow the Workflow**  
   See how work is advancing, where it’s slowing, and who is involved.

4. **Spot the Signals**  
   Catch the important updates, risks, and hints that help you stay ahead.

5. **Dig Into the Details**  
   Explore the deeper logs, tables, and histories when you need more context.

You don’t need to memorize the flow — your eyes naturally follow it.  
Makerfex simply designs the page so your brain doesn’t have to work as hard.

## Dashboards With Purpose, Not Panic

Many systems overwhelm you with charts. Makerfex refuses to.

Every panel on the screen answers at least one of three essential questions:

1. **What’s happening right now?**  
   KPIs that instantly set the scene.

2. **How is it moving?**  
   Sparklines, timelines, and hero charts that reveal momentum.

3. **What needs my attention?**  
   Visual cues that highlight risks, bottlenecks, or shifting priorities.

!!! note "What’s a KPI?"
    A **Key Performance Indicator** is a metric that captures something essential about your shop.  
    Think of KPIs as the headlines of your dashboard’s story — quick, clear, and to the point.

## A Visual Story — Not a Spreadsheet in Costume

Makerfex dashboards guide the eye intentionally:

- **KPIs** open the narrative. *(Check the Pulse)*  
- **Hero charts** add plot and movement. *(Read the Momentum)*  
- **Context panels** reveal who is doing what, and why. *(Follow the Workflow)*  
- **Activity, alerts, and summaries** show what’s shifting. *(Spot the Signals)*  
- **Tables** provide the detailed evidence at the bottom. *(Dig Into the Details)*  

Color is never decoration — it’s a language.  
Layout isn’t accidental — it’s storytelling.

## Machine Learning: When the Story Learns With You

Machine learning helps Makerfex notice patterns early:

- Projects likely to fall behind  
- Materials trending toward shortages  
- Workload patterns repeating  
- Stages prone to bottlenecking  

These insights appear where they naturally enhance the narrative — not as noise, but as helpful cues.

!!! tip "Why Machine Learning (and Not 'AI')?"
    Makerfex uses statistical pattern recognition, not hype.  
    It doesn’t replace your judgment or pretend it knows better than you.  
    It simply reads your shop’s history and highlights patterns you might want to know.  
    You stay in control — always.

## Dashboards That Work the Way Makers Think

Your shop is alive. Tasks shift, materials move, customers change their minds.

Makerfex dashboards reflect that motion clearly and calmly. They bring the important parts of your story into focus, so you always know:

- what’s working,  
- what needs attention,  
- and what’s coming next.

This is the Makerfex way.
