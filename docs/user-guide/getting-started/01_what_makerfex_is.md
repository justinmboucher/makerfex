# What Makerfex Is (and Isn’t)

Makerfex is a shop management system built for makers — not a traditional project management tool.

It exists to help you understand **time, capacity, and commitments** before they become problems, not just to track tasks after the fact.

## What Makerfex Is

Makerfex helps you answer questions like:

- Do I actually have time to finish what I’ve committed to?
- Am I overloading my shop without realizing it?
- Where is risk building — in deadlines, materials, or workload?
- Which kinds of work are worth the time they consume?

It’s designed for real shop constraints:
limited space, uneven demand, material lead times, and deadlines that don’t politely space themselves out.

## What Makerfex Isn’t

Makerfex is not:
- a to-do list,
- a task-first project tracker,
- or a status-reporting tool built for stakeholders.

Tasks matter — but they’re not where owners make their hardest decisions.
