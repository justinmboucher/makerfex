# If You’re Coming From a Traditional PM Tool

If you’ve used tools like Jira, Asana, Trello, or similar systems, Makerfex may feel different at first — and that’s intentional.

## How Traditional PM Tools Think

Most project management systems assume:
- tasks are the primary unit of work,
- progress is the sum of completed tasks,
- risk appears late, when things fall behind.

This works well for coordination-heavy environments.

## How Makerfex Thinks Differently

Makerfex starts with **capacity**, not tasks.

Instead of asking:
“What tasks are left?”

It asks:
“Can this shop actually absorb this work?”

Owners rarely fail because they forgot a task.
They fail because they committed to more work than their shop could realistically handle.
