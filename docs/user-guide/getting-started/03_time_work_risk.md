# How Makerfex Thinks About Time, Work, and Risk

Time is the one resource every shop shares — and the one you can’t recover.

## Time Comes Before Revenue

Revenue matters. But revenue without time context is misleading.

High-revenue work that:
- takes weeks to complete,
- occupies valuable shop space,
- blocks other projects,
- or increases deadline risk,

is not automatically good work.

Makerfex always frames revenue relative to time, capacity, and risk.

## Owners and Employees See Different Things

Makerfex intentionally separates views:

- Employees see tasks, assignments, and daily work.
- Owners see capacity, flow, and risk.

Owners don’t need another task list.
They need to know whether their commitments are still safe.

## Dashboards Are Read, Not Studied

The Makerfex owner dashboard answers one question immediately:

“Am I safe on time, space, and commitments today?”

Urgency is made clear first.
Explanation comes later.
