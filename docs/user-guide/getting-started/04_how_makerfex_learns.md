# How Makerfex Learns as Your Shop Grows

As your shop runs through Makerfex, patterns begin to emerge — not because the system is clever, but because it’s paying attention.

!!! note "A quick word about AI"
    Makerfex uses **machine learning**, not general-purpose artificial intelligence.

    It analyzes historical patterns in your own data — timing, repetition, bottlenecks — and highlights things you may want to know.

    It does not make decisions for you.
    It does not replace judgment.
    It does not tell you what to do.

## What Makerfex Learns Over Time

Makerfex can surface signals such as:
- project types that consistently take longer than expected,
- materials that frequently cause delays,
- workflow stages that repeatedly bottleneck,
- periods where deadlines cluster.

These appear as signals, not commands.

## Learning That Respects Reality

Makerfex doesn’t assume perfect data or perfect planning.

It learns slowly, conservatively, and transparently — because your shop is a living system, not a spreadsheet.
