# Changing Your Focus Later

Your shop won’t stay the same — and Makerfex doesn’t expect it to.

As your workload, season, or priorities change, you may want your dashboards and insights to emphasize different things. That’s normal, and it’s built into how Makerfex works.

Changing your focus isn’t a reset.  
It’s an adjustment.

## Focus Is a Lens, Not a Mode

In Makerfex, *focus* controls **emphasis**, not access.

Changing your focus:
- does **not** remove features
- does **not** hide data
- does **not** undo your setup

It simply changes:
- what appears first,
- what is visually emphasized,
- and how insights are framed.

Think of it like rotating the workbench lamp — not rebuilding the shop.

## When It Makes Sense to Change Focus

Many owners adjust focus when:

- the season changes (holiday rush vs off-season),
- workload increases or decreases,
- they shift sales channels,
- they hire help or lose capacity,
- they feel pressure building and want clarity.

There’s no “wrong” time to change focus.  
If something feels off, that’s usually the signal.

## Ways to Change Your Focus

Makerfex gives you a few ways to adjust focus over time.

### 1. Change Dashboard Focus Directly
You can switch your dashboard focus at any time. This updates:
- the hero chart,
- KPI emphasis,
- and which insights are surfaced first.

Nothing else changes.

### 2. Revisit the Setup Questions
If your priorities have shifted more fundamentally, you can re-run the setup questions.

This helps Makerfex:
- re-center what you care about,
- adjust default emphasis,
- and recalibrate guidance.

Your historical data stays intact.

### 3. Ignore the Focus Entirely
This is allowed too.

You can browse freely, dig into details, or use Makerfex in a more exploratory way. Focus is there to help — not to constrain.

## What Happens to Learning and Insights

Changing focus doesn’t erase learning.

Machine learning in Makerfex:
- continues observing patterns,
- adapts to new behavior over time,
- and adjusts what it highlights based on your current focus.

If your declared focus and observed behavior don’t match, Makerfex shows both — without judgment.

You decide which matters more.

---

## You’re Not Locking Anything In

Makerfex assumes:
- priorities evolve,
- shops grow,
- and constraints shift.

That’s why nothing about focus is permanent.

If something stops feeling useful, you’re always free to change it — calmly, without penalties or resets.

## The Point of Focus

Focus exists for one reason:

**To help you see what matters right now, faster.**

When “right now” changes, your focus should too.

Makerfex is built to move with your shop, not freeze it in time.
