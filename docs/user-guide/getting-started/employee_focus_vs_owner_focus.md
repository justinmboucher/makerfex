# Employee Focus vs Owner Focus

Makerfex is designed around a simple idea:

**Different roles need different information — at different times — for different reasons.**

That’s why Makerfex separates *employee focus* from *owner focus*. Not to restrict access, but to keep attention where it belongs.

## Same Shop, Different Responsibilities

Employees and owners work in the same shop, but they don’t carry the same responsibilities.

Employees are focused on:
- what needs to be done,
- what they’re responsible for today,
- what’s blocking their work,
- and what’s coming up next.

Owners are focused on:
- whether commitments are still safe,
- whether capacity is being exceeded,
- whether deadlines are at risk,
- and whether time is being spent wisely.

Makerfex reflects that difference intentionally.

## Employee Focus: Doing the Work

Employee-focused views are built around **execution**.

They emphasize:
- assigned tasks,
- upcoming deadlines,
- in-progress work,
- workflow stages,
- and day-to-day priorities.

The goal is clarity and momentum:
- What do I need to work on right now?
- What’s next?
- What’s blocking me?

Employees shouldn’t have to interpret high-level metrics to do good work.

---

## Owner Focus: Protecting Commitments

Owner-focused views are built around **risk, capacity, and flow**.

They emphasize:
- work-in-progress pressure,
- throughput and completion trends,
- deadline risk,
- material and capacity constraints,
- and time-relative performance.

The goal is early awareness:
- Are we taking on too much?
- Are we likely to miss commitments?
- Where is pressure building?
- What needs attention before it becomes a problem?

Owners don’t need another task list.  
They need to know whether the system is holding together.

---

## Why Tasks Don’t Appear on the Owner Dashboard

Tasks matter — but they’re not the right signal at the owner level.

A long task list doesn’t tell an owner:
- whether deadlines are safe,
- whether capacity is exceeded,
- or whether work is flowing smoothly.

That information lives in **patterns**, not checkboxes.

Tasks belong where they’re actionable:
- employee dashboards,
- project detail pages,
- and execution views.

---

## Shared Data, Different Lenses

Employees and owners are always looking at the **same underlying data**.

The difference is presentation:
- Employees see what helps them execute.
- Owners see what helps them decide.

No data is hidden.
No one is locked out.
The system simply respects context.

---

## Focus Is About Respecting Attention

The separation between employee and owner focus isn’t about hierarchy.

It’s about respecting attention.

When people see only what’s relevant to their role:
- work feels calmer,
- decisions come faster,
- and problems surface earlier.

Makerfex doesn’t assume one view fits everyone.

It gives each role the information they need — when they need it — without noise.

---

## You Can Always Look Deeper

If an owner wants to:
- inspect tasks,
- review project details,
- or understand execution issues,

those paths are always available.

The dashboards just don’t force that depth on you unless you ask for it.

---

## The Point of Separation

Employee focus exists to help work move forward.

Owner focus exists to help the shop stay healthy.

Both matter.  
They just answer different questions.
